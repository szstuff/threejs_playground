**Puppy Playground**
Puppy Playground is a first-person experience developed using Three.js over a weekend. The goal of the project was to explore the capabilities of Three.js.
The user can explore the apartment using standard FPS controls (WASD + mouse) and watch the puppies roaming around. 

**Bugs**
-Puppies tend to approach walls and windows, sometimes jumping out and disappearing from the scene.
-Lack of collision detection between puppies and the player.

**To experience Puppy Playground:**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a supported browser.
Explore the apartment and enjoy the experience.
