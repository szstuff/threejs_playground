**ThreeJS Playground**    
ThreeJS Playground is a first-person experience developed using Three.js over a weekend. The goal of the project was to explore the capabilities of Three.js.  
The user can explore an apartment using standard FPS controls (WASD + mouse) and watch puppies roaming around.   

**Bugs and issues**   
- Puppies tend to approach walls and windows, sometimes jumping out and disappearing from the scene.  
- Puppies tend to levitate when climbing up curtains or other objects in the map.   
- Puppies are created as Capsule objects, which helps with collision (with the map) but makes their behaviour more difficult to manipulate  
- Lack of collision detection between puppies and the player.  

**To experience Puppy Playground:**  
Clone this repository to your local machine.  
Run this in the terminal to install dependencies and run the project locally:  
```
"npm install && npx vite"
```
Click the localhost link provided by vite to open the preview in browser.  
Explore the apartment and enjoy the experience.
